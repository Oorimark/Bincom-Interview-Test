## Bincom Test
### Summary:
    The application built is a solution to Bincom Test Interview for Experienced Software Developer. It only has two solution out of the three problems given, but solutions provided was well written and easy to understand. 

### Challenges:
    One major challenges I faced was getting data from the database up to the client. I tried almost all the answers I say of Stackflow and even other sites. Though I settled for an option which is deprecated that storing the data in a file first and then taken the data to the client, it was my idea though. The problem is that it won't work well when multiple users are unto the site.

### Suggestion:
    The application can be furthur improved on by Using WebSocket to connect the server to the client. This is said so the user can have a seemless experience while using the applicaiton
